    <p>Elevator Pitch(place holder):<br>
        BingeBuddy! because Pirating is Illegal!
        <p>Problem Description:<br>
        with an over abundance of streaming services, especially ones that require a subscription to view exclusive shows and movies,
        it becomes difficult to track and keep track of a users favorite shows and updates to them.
        it also becomes a hassel as it would also require users to sift through multiple services to find a show that might peak their interest, taking up time and could either annoy or even drive users away from certain platforms as a result</p>
        <p> Customers:<br>
        those with multiple subscriptions to streaming services and those looking for reccomendations both in their existing subscriptions as well as other services they are not yet subscribed to.
        <p>Solution:<br>
        binge buddy would take user data as well as tags/serivice data from the streaming services to better reccomend as well as keep track of shows the users wish to follow, resulting in a streamlined experience for the user to search, gain reccomendations, as well as keep up to date with their existing tagged or followed shows.</p>
